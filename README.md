# WorkOrderWizard
A system for tracking work orders and billing for all of your customers.

## What is it?
WOW is a system for tracking work orders / invoices, by customer. The app will be available to users under the Freemium model. Users will sign up for a account and will be able to log into a central site to manage and track all expenses and receipts for work done for their customers. It will support creating and exporting work orders and invoices. If users so choose they can also track their suppliers and material expenses in the system as well as their invoices, which enables them to calculate the entire cost basis for a given customer or work order, which can be useful for purposes of tax preparation.

## Tech Stack
MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node)

Built for the desktop experience as well as native mobile. React Native will be used to create iOS and Android smartphone apps.

Depending on our needs during the development process, we may choose to employ Reduct or Context API in order to track application state.

## Deployment
This will be a cloud-based service. We may choose to utilize an automatically scaling deployment service such as Amazon Elastic Beanstalk.
